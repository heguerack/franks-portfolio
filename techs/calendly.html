<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  A simple wrapper to drop Calendly into my React projects.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  I use React Calendly when I want to embed my booking link directly into a page
  — whether it's a contact section or a call-to-action. It’s clean, quick to
  implement, and keeps users on-site instead of sending them somewhere else.

  It’s one of those tools that just makes things smoother — for me and the
  people booking.

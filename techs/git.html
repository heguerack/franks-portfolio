<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">Git</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  My go-to tool for version control and collaboration.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  Git lets me track code changes, roll back mistakes, and work with others
  without stepping on toes. I use it daily — whether it's managing solo projects
  or collaborating through GitHub.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Keeps all my code changes organized and
    recoverable
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Essential for branching, merging, and
    experimenting safely
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  Every project on my portfolio is tracked with Git — I wouldn't ship anything
  without it.

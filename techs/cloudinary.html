  One of my go‑to tools for image storage, optimization, and delivery.

  I offload all the heavy lifting—resizing, smart cropping, responsive formats
  like WebP or AVIF—to Cloudinary. It keeps my sites fast and flexible without
  having to manage a complex image pipeline. Upload presets let me handle user
  content securely without writing extra logic.

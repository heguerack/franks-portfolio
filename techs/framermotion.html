<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">Framer Motion</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  My choice when I need refined, interruptible animations in React.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  I don’t use it often — especially now with server components, where it can get
  in the way. Most of the time, I roll my own lightweight animations. But when a
  project truly calls for high‑quality motion, Framer Motion gives me power and
  polish with minimal effort.

    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Natural-feeling spring and tween animations
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  For those moments where animation matters, Framer Motion delivers without
  making things messy.

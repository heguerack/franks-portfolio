<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">React Query</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  Client-side data fetching and caching that just works.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  I’ve used React Query to manage server state, background revalidation, and
  mutations — keeping UI fast and loading/error states consistent. Lately, I’ve
  leaned more into Next.js features like server actions and data fetching on the
  server. But for highly interactive pages where SEO isn’t a concern, React
  Query is still my go-to.

<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  It cuts the boilerplate so I can focus on the actual UI logic.

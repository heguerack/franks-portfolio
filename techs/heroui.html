<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">HeroUI</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  A component system I use when I want sensible defaults with room to customize.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  It gives me accessible building blocks that I can theme with Tailwind. I keep
  the UI cohesive without locking myself into heavy abstractions.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Accessible by default, easy to restyle
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  Good starting point when I need to move fast without sacrificing polish.

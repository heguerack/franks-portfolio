<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">Formik</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  A form library that keeps complex forms manageable.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  Formik centralizes form state, validation, and submission so my components
  stay focused. I’ll pair it with Yup or Zod depending on the project.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Great for multi‑step and dynamic forms
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  When forms get tricky, Formik keeps the code organized and predictable.

<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">BetterAuth</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  A modern auth toolkit I use when I want fine‑grained control without
  rebuilding the basics.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  BetterAuth gives me an opinionated foundation—sessions, tokens, email
  flows-while letting me still customize providers and policies. It fits
  projects where the login experience is part of the product.

<ul>
  <li><span class="franks-dot"></span>Fast to set up, easy to extend</li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  Great for apps where auth UX and rules can’t be an afterthought.

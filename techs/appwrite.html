<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">Appwrite</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  My preferred backend-in-a-box when I want auth, database, and storage without
  spinning up servers.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  I use Appwrite to ship fullâ€‘stack features quickly: email/password or OAuth
  login, document databases, file uploads, and serverless functions when I need
  custom logic. It lets me stay in the UI flow while still checking the boxes on
  security and data.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="franks-dot"></span>Auth, DB, storage in one place</li>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Great DX for quick prototypes that can go to
    production
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  If a project needs real users and data on a tight timeline, Appwrite is
  usually my first pick.

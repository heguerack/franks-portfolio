<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">HTML</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  The backbone of every page I build — plain and simple.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  HTML structures the content users see: text, images, links, and more. It’s not
  flashy, but it’s fundamental. I handwrite most of my HTML, keeping it clean,
  semantic, and accessible — and when it comes to repetitive boilerplate, I’ll
  happily hand that off to ChatGPT.

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Defines the structure and meaning of all
    site content
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Works with CSS and JavaScript to create full
    UI behavior
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  From static sites to full-stack apps, everything starts with solid HTML.

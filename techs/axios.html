<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">Axios</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  A small, dependable HTTP client I use across React and Node.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  I prefer Axios for its interceptors and clean error handling. It makes auth
  headers, retries, and typed responses (with TS) straightforward, and keeps my
  data layer readable.
</p>
<ul>
  <!-- <li><span class="franks-dot"></span>Global interceptors for auth/refresh</li> -->
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Consistent JSON handling on client and
    server
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  It’s the glue between my UI and APIs—simple, predictable, and easy to test.

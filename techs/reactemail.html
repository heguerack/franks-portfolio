<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">React Email</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  Lets me build emails using components — just like in my React apps.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  Traditional HTML emails often rely on clunky table-based layouts and inline
  styles to display correctly in all inboxes. With React Email, I can write
  clean, reusable JSX components for password resets, confirmations, and contact
  forms, while it handles all the tricky compatibility stuff.

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Used to build styled confirmation and
    notification emails
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Paired with <code>Resend</code> for reliable
    delivery
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Keeps my email templates readable and
    maintainable
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  I used it in my contact form project — when users submit a message, they get
  an auto-reply built entirely with React Email components.

<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">UploadThing</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  User file uploads with guardrails and good defaults.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  I use UploadThing to manage client→server→storage flows with size limits,
  validation, and secure URLs. It keeps the pipeline simple and auditable.

    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Tight Next.js integration, secure by default
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  Great when an app needs uploads without building the plumbing.

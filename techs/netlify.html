<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">Netlify</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  Along with Vercel, it's one of my go-to platforms for static websites.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  Netlify handles deployment, HTTPS, and CI/CD out of the box. I just push code
  to GitHub, and it goes live. It’s ideal for JAMstack sites, and I use it for
  smaller frontend projects and demo builds.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Push-to-deploy workflow keeps things fast and simple</li>
  <li>Includes serverless functions, form handling, and more</li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  Most of my smaller sites — like this portfolio — have been deployed on Netlify
  at some point.

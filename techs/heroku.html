<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">Heroku</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  The first platform I used to deploy full-stack apps — quick, simple, and
  beginner‑friendly.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  I used Heroku when I was just getting into backend work. It handled my
  Node/Express apps with zero config, and taught me how deployment actually
  works. I still use it sometimes for quick demos or testing APIs without
  needing a full cloud setup.

<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  Heroku was my gateway into DevOps — still useful when I need to spin up
  something fast.

<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  My go-to tools for password hashing and secure user auth.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  I use bcrypt or bcryptjs when handling user passwords. They offer the same
  API, but bcryptjs is a pure JavaScript implementation—perfect for development
  environments where native bindings aren’t available. For production, I prefer
  bcrypt for stronger performance. Either way, both libraries help ensure user
  credentials are never stored in plain text.

  When storing passwords, I don’t compromise—bcrypt does the heavy lifting
  securely.

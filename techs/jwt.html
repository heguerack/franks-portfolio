<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">JWT</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  A compact token format for stateless auth between services.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  JWTs make it easy to pass identity and claims through APIs. I sign securely,
  keep expirations tight, and rotate secrets—practical security, not theater.

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Short‑lived tokens, refresh flows when
    needed
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  Used carefully, JWTs keep auth snappy without loading the DB.

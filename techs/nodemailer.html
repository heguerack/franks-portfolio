<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">Nodemailer</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  My go-to for sending emails from the backend — no fancy dashboards, just full
  control.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  Nodemailer is great when I want to send transactional emails directly from a
  server. It’s simple, flexible, and works well with Gmail, Mailtrap, or any
  SMTP service. I like using Resend for production projects because it handles
  deliverability and has a nice UI — but when budget matters, Nodemailer gets
  the job done for free.

<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  If I’m bootstrapping or testing, Nodemailer is the easiest way to send emails
  fast.

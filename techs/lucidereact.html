<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">Lucide React</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  Crisp, consistent icons that fit right into my React components.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  I like Lucide because it’s lightweight and looks professional out of the box.
  I compose icons with buttons and inputs so they feel part of the system.

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Icon set that styles well with
    Tailwind/Shadcn
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  Good icons shouldn’t steal attention—these support the content.

<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">React</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">
  My main JavaScript UI library — components, hooks, and state where it matters.
</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  I started using React because its component model just made sense — reusable,
  dynamic, and easier to scale than plain HTML. I focus on small, composable
  pieces and predictable data-fetching. Accessibility and keyboard flows are
  part of every UI decision I make.

    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Initial load might be slow, but blazing fast
    after that
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  React helps me move fast without sacrificing structure or clarity.

<h3 class="dialog-tech-content-h3">Drizzle</h3>
<p class="dialog-tech-intro">A type‑safe SQL toolkit that's growing on me</p>
<p class="dialog-tech-content-desc">
  I mostly use Prisma, but lately I’ve been learning Drizzle and starting to
  appreciate its flexibility. It’s simpler than it looks, and I like how close
  it feels to writing raw SQL—just with type safety baked in. Still early days
  for me, but I’m already seeing where it could shine.

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Typed schemas, clean migrations, no magic
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="franks-dot"></span>Good fit for lightweight or edge-first apps
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="dialog-tech-conclusion">
  Still experimenting, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Drizzle becomes a regular
  in my stack.

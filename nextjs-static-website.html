        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class="project-block">
          <h2>Why This Stack?</h2>
          <p>
            After practicing with the MERN stack, Next.js felt like the right
            next step. It lets me use modern features while delivering both
            static and dynamic pages.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Learnings -->
        <div class="project-block">
          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Improved my merging of server components with client components to
              add interactivity while still delivering static content — using
              wrappers and children where needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved my critical thinking on how pages and content render, and
              how to optimize them for speed and user experience without
              sacrificing SEO.
            </li>
            <li>Started learning how to work with other teams using Git.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Highlights -->
        <div class="project-block">
          <h2>Cool Touches</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Calendly integration for easy booking</li>
            <li>
              A gallery with project cards, each containing its own mini-gallery
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Next Steps -->
        <div class="project-block">
          <h2>Future Ideas</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Design and create better cards for both Google reviews as well as
              HomeStars ones.
            </li>
            <li>
              Optimize images a bit in our services section.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It seems like only the first card is static while the other 5
                  are dynamic — not sure yet, have to dig into that.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One idea is to force shadCN to render all images right away,
                  but then stop the loading initially and fetch them as soon as
                  the page loads.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add an online payment system connecting invoice ID, user ID,
                  and payments — something along those lines.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Add a feature for online estimates.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Leads could add measurements, images, even videos — and get a
                  5% discount if done this way.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once I learn more about AI agents and MCPs, I might add nice
                  features like chats, routing, checking invoices — pretty much
                  automating to the max. But that’s why I’m still learning!!
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Maybe even add an actual portal where clients can log in to check
              the colours they used, formulas, invoices, and hey, maybe even
              promotions that way!!
            </li>

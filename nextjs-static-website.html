        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class="project-block">
          <h2>Why This Stack?</h2>
          <p>
            After practicing with the MERN stack, Next.js felt like the right
            next step. It let me use modern features while delivering both
            static and dynamic pages.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Learnings -->
        <div class="project-block">
          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Merged server and client components to add interactivity while
              still delivering static content — using wrappers and children
              where needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved my thinking around how content renders and loads, and how
              to optimize it for speed and user experience without hurting SEO.
            </li>
            <li>
              Learned how to use static regeneration to load data on static
              pages directly from the server and rebuild the page periodically —
              getting the best of both static and dynamic rendering.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Highlights -->
        <div class="project-block">
          <h2>Cool Touches</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Calendly integration for easy bookings</li>
            <li>
              A project gallery, with each card having its own mini-gallery
            </li>
            <li>
              Real SEO improvements — the site is live and actually bringing in
              business!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Next Steps -->
        <div class="project-block">
          <h2>Future Ideas</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Design better cards for Google Reviews and HomeStars listings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Optimize images in the services section.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It seems like only the first card is static while the others
                  are dynamic — not 100% sure yet, still digging.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maybe force ShadCN to render all images immediately, then
                  lazy-load after initial page load.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Add an online payment system — ideally linking invoice ID, user
              ID, and payment status.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add an online estimate feature:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Leads could upload measurements, images, even videos — and get
                  a 5% discount for using this option.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once I learn more about AI agents and MCPs, I'd love to add
                  smart features like chat, invoice lookups, and automated
                  workflows. Still learning, though!
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Maybe even build a client portal to let users log in, view past
              invoices, paint formulas, and even unlock promotions.
            </li>
          </ul>

## Set up Turborepo

- Learn how to set up monorepos
- go to shadND, not sure why there lol `https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo`
- ok I see , using monorepos and shaCn combo makes shadCN clash, so here is the best option we have `https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo`
- use the pnpm version `pnpm dlx shadcn@canary init` this one in this case `pnpm dlx shadcn@2.9.2 init`
- selec mext.js monorepo

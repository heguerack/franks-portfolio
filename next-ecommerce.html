        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class="project-block">
          <h2>Why This Stack?</h2>
          <p>
            Because like I mentioned before, the idea of learning Next.js was to
            be able to deliver not only fancy static websites but also real web
            apps.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Learnings -->
        <div class="project-block">
          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Improved my NextAuth/auth.js knowledge</li>
            <li>Improved my skills with payments using Stripe</li>
            <li>
              Learned about React templates and how to combine them with Resend
              for nice-looking emails
            </li>
            <li>Solidified my flow with shadCN, Zod, and React Hook Form</li>
            <li>Greatly improved my Prisma ORM knowledge</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Highlights -->
        <div class="project-block">
          <h2>Cool Touches</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>User/admin auth roles</li>
            <li>Smooth dark/light mode</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Next Steps -->
        <div class="project-block">
          <h2>Future Ideas</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Add user roles/authorization to routes so that other admins can
              add their own products, and of course have a super admin as well
            </li>
            <li>Add buttons and features for smoother navigation</li>
            <li>
              Fix the way the cart is set up. Right now, once we go to the
              payment page, the cart gets destroyed in the database — I’m not
              sure if it stays locally in a cookie or something. I want to make
              it so that the cart only disappears once the payment is
              successful. The issue is that if the payment doesn’t go through,
              visitors have to go back, grab items again, and rebuild their
              cart.
            </li>
            <li>Improve the auth system in general</li>
          </ul>
